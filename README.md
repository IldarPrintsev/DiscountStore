# Task
Implement the code for a discount store checkout that calculates the total price of all items. Goods are priced individually, however there are special offers from time to time when multiple items are bought.
The checkout accepts the items in any order, so that if we add a big mug, a vase and then another big mug, we’ll recognise two mugs apply the discount of 2 for 1.5€.  You should be able to add multiple items and then call a totalling method which will return you a price for all items you have added. Removing method should work in the same logic manner.
